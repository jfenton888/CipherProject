# CipherProject
### by Jack Fenton, Henry Lockwood, and Revant Kantamneni
### Decode or Encode a message with our cipher program.
### Features Morse, Caesar, and Unicode
##### Project Summary: In this project, we created three ciphers which can be used to decode or encode message. All the classes and functions are in one file. This project creates a seperate file in which the encrypted/decrpted messages are in after it has been run.
###### Note: There is a similar project in the branch 'revant' which fufils all the guidelines for this assignment.

##### Lockwood Reflection:
While I thought that this project was interesting I also feel like it was unnecesarily complex. The requirement of having two separate 
files made the project feel more difficult to work with because we had to worry about sending information and keeping track of variables. Github was also more annoying to use than anticipated, because it was hard when multiple people were working on the same code at the same time. It was also difficult to work on at night because once the internet turns off for a boarder, it can be hard to actually keep helping. In terms of the actual code, I helped with the symbol portion, and ended up using the framework that Jack Fenton had put togehter in order to take the input and turn it into special characters. I also added the comments to the class code.
